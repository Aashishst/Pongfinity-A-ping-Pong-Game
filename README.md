## üõ†Ô∏è Prerequisites

* Python 3.8+
* Pygame

Install Pygame:

```bash
pip install pygame
```

---

## Run locally

- There are two ways to do this. Both are shown below.

### Method 1:

1. Go to the repo
     
2. Open the Python folder

3.  Download a file(In a premade folder **(Recommended)**)
'
### Method 2

1. Clone the repo:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Aashishst/Pongfinity-A-ping-Pong-Game.git
cd Pongfinity-A-ping-Pong-Game
```

2. (Recommended) create a virtualenv and activate it
3. Install dependencies and run:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt   # or pip install pygame
python Aashish-K_Pongfinity.py
```

---

## ‚å®Ô∏è Controls

* **Multiplayer:**

  * Player 1: `W` (up), `S` (down)
  * Player 2: `‚Üë` / `‚Üì` (up/down)
* **Single Player:** `‚Üê` / `‚Üí` to move paddle
* **Global:** `Q` to quit (or close window)

---

## üì¶ Packaging into an executable

Build on the target OS (Windows ‚Üí Windows, Linux ‚Üí Linux).

**Windows example (PyInstaller):**

```bash
pip install pyinstaller
pyinstaller --onefile --windowed Aashish-K_Pongfinity.py
```

* Result: `dist/Aashish-K_Pongfinity.exe` (zip it and upload to Releases or itch.io)
* If you add assets later, include with `--add-data "assets;assets"` (Windows) or `--add-data "assets:assets"` (Linux/macOS).

---

## üß© Asset & packaging tips

* The script currently uses plain-text highscores and system fonts ‚Äî bundle a `.ttf` for consistent typography across systems.
* When adding images/sounds, use the helper below to load files reliably (works with PyInstaller):

```python
import sys, os

def resource_path(relative_path):
    if getattr(sys, 'frozen', False):
        base = sys._MEIPASS
    else:
        base = os.path.abspath('.')
    return os.path.join(base, relative_path)
```

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Troubleshooting

* **404 on GitHub Pages:** Pages needs an `index.html` ‚Äî GitHub Pages can't run Pygame.
* **Missing score files:** The game auto-creates them; delete to reset.
* **Black window / no display:** Ensure Pygame installed and a display server (X/Wayland) is available on Linux.
* **AV flags on exe:** New binaries can trigger false positives; sign binaries or inform users.
